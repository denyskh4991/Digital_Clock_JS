# Digital Clock
<p>This project implements a real-time digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds with a modern design, suitable for enhancing the visual appeal of web applications or personal websites.</p>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<h3>Real-Time Clock Display</h3>
<p>The clock updates every second to display the current time, using a 24-hour format. The time is formatted with leading zeros for single-digit hours, minutes, and seconds, ensuring a consistent visual presentation.</p>
<h3>Modern UI Design</h3>
<p>The clock is styled with a sleek, modern interface, featuring a gradient background and glassmorphism effects. The digits are large and easy to read, with each time unit (hours, minutes, seconds) labeled clearly.</p> 
<h2>Technical Overview</h2>
<h3>HTML Structure</h3>
<p>The HTML file structures the clock within a `div` container. Each time unit (hours, minutes, seconds) is enclosed in a `span` element, allowing for individual styling and real-time updates through JavaScript.</p>
<h3>CSS Styling</h3>
<h4>Design and Layout</h4>
<p>The clock is centered on the page within a container that features a soft gradient background and a blurred effect. The clock's digits are styled with large fonts and positioned within a semi-transparent box, which uses the backdrop-filter property for a glass-like appearance.</p>
<h4>Responsive Design</h4>
<p>The clock layout is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes while maintaining its aesthetic appeal. The container and clock elements adjust their size and positioning to ensure a consistent user experience across devices.</p>
<h3>JavaScript Functionality</h3>
<h4>Time Updating</h4>
<p>The JavaScript file includes a script that retrieves the current time using the `Date` object. The hours, minutes, and seconds are extracted and updated every second using the `setInterval` function, ensuring the displayed time is always accurate.</p>

    setInterval(() => {
        // Function to update time every second
    }, 1000);

<h2>In Summary</h2> 
<p>This digital clock project provides a visually appealing and functional time display component for web pages. With its modern design, responsive layout, and real-time updates, it serves as both a practical tool and a stylish element for enhancing user interfaces.</p>
